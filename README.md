## Medical Appointment Management System

-  I have focused on is the separation of responsibilities within the application. By adhering to the principles of modular design and the SOLID principles,
-  In terms of architectural patterns, I have followed the REST (Representational State Transfer) principles. RESTful architecture emphasizes the use of standard HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to define and manipulate resources.
-  a complete CRUD functionality. It includes the creation of users, specifically doctors and patients, as well as listing, updating, and deleting user records. Additionally, it offers the ability to schedule and cancel appointments.
```
The listing feature allows users to view the existing records of doctors and patients. This functionality provides a comprehensive overview of the available users, including their details such as name, contact information, and role.
